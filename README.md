# Machine Learning: Tutorial notebooks

Each notebook is dedicated to one ML algorithm. It contains a theoretical description of the algorithm together with hands-on application.
The applications relies on Python sklearn library and takes inspiration from https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html handbook.
You'll find a concept summy section at the end of each notebook.
